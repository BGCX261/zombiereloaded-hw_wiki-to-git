We're not sure if we're going to use this site as our main repository server. However, full compilable source code snapshots are available in the release packages (currently only in patches).

We use Mercurial as the version control system and you need it to clone complete source code repositories. Use Mercurial on Linux (command line tools), or TortoiseHg on Windows (both GUI and command line tools).

See [Compiling_Zombie_Reloaded Compiling Zombie:Reloaded] for information about compiling.

==Repositories==

Main host for repositories: http://helgeby.no-ip.org/zrdev/hg/

*Note:* The main host is a private site and available bandwidth is limited. *Please use our mirrors below:*

==zr-dev==

*Repository:* http://code.google.com/p/zombiereloaded/source/list?repo=zr-dev

Our main development branch. New features and experimental stuff is available here.

Note that builds of zr-dev may or may not work at all. We also may do changes that suddenly break compatibility.

==zr-3-0-b2==

*Note:* The name is incorrect because of technical limitations. Real name at our main server is: zr-3.0-b2

*Repository:* http://code.google.com/p/zombiereloaded/source/list?repo=zr-3-0-b2

This is our stable branch for the beta 2 release. It will be updated with mostly bug fixes, but could also get new small features.

Any revision of this branch should be considered stable, and can be used on main game servers.
