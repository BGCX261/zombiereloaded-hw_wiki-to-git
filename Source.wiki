=Source Code=

The source code repositories on this site are not always up to date. We're not sure if we're going to use this site as our main repository server. However, full compilable source code snapshots are available in the release packages (currently only in patches).

We use Mercurial as the version control system and you need it to clone complete source code repositories. Use Mercurial on Linux (command line tools), or TortoiseHg on Windows (both GUI and command line tools).

==Repositories==

Main host for repositories: http://helgeby.no-ip.org/zrdev/hg/

*Note:* The main host is a private site and available bandwidth is limited.

==How to obtain the latest changes with highest speed==
Since our main host is slow, there's still a solution for fast download:
  # Clone our repository from this site first (here at Google Code). Use the repository links below and switch to checkout view to get a full clone URL of the selected repository.
  # Then pull latest changes from the main host (helgeby.no-ip-org).

==zr-dev==

*Repository:* http://code.google.com/p/zombiereloaded/source/list?repo=zr-dev

Our main development branch. New features and experimental stuff is available here.

Note that builds of zr-dev may or may not work at all. We also may do changes that suddenly break compatibility.

==zr-3-0-b2==

*Note:* The name is incorrect because of technical limitations. Real name at our main server is: zr-3.0-b2

*Repository:* http://code.google.com/p/zombiereloaded/source/list?repo=zr-3-0-b2

This is our stable branch for the beta 2 release. It will be updated with mostly bug fixes, but could also get new small features.

Any revision of this branch should be considered stable, and can be used on main game servers.
